# Global Templates

This folder contains Bicep templates for global resources that are shared across regions, such as:

- Azure Traffic Manager for global traffic routing and failover.
- Virtual Network (VNet) peering between primary and secondary regions.

These templates ensure the seamless connection and failover of resources in a multi-region architecture.
